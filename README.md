# Iaorana ü§ô
### Of Tahitian üå¥ origin, I have lived France for ten years.

Holder of a master's degree in Aeronautical Mechanical Engineering, I worked for 3 years in aeronautics as a consultant.
 
I joined  in September 2020 the Fullstack Web Developer training course at the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-FR/campus/toulouse) in Toulouse.

I am currently looking for a company where to carry out my 6-month end-of-training internship from February 15th. The internship will focus on front-end, back-end or fullstack development as well as the technologies studied and practiced.

### Technos
| | | |
|-|-|-|
| Javascript | Typescript | React | Node.js     |
| Html/CSS   | Python     | Django| Git/ GitHub |
| PHP        | MySQL      | Unix  | Netlify     |
| Palantir   | Sharepoint | Catia |             |


I want to integrate myself into this company for a long time and am therefore looking for an internship that can lead to a job creation. Finally, being keen to improve my skills, I would like to join a team whose expertise, high standards and cohesion will allow me to evolve as a developer.
