### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Of Tahitian origin, I have lived France for ten years.

Holder of a master's degree in Aeronautical Mechanical Engineering, I worked for 3 years in aeronautics as a consultant.
 
Following a first experience in development on Sharepoint and data visualization on Palantir. I wanted to deepen my skills in web development through a professional retraining.

After a year of self-training in Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, in September 2020 I joined the Fullstack Web Developer training course at the Wild Code School in Toulouse.

I am currently looking for a company where to carry out my 6-month end-of-training internship from February 15th. The internship will focus on front-end, back-end or fullstack development as well as the technologies studied and practiced (JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, PHP).

I want to integrate myself into this company for a long time and am therefore looking for an internship that can lead to a job creation. Finally, being keen to improve my skills, I would like to join a team whose expertise, high standards and cohesion will allow me to evolve as a developer.
