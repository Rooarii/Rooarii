# Iaorana (Hello) 🤙
### Of Tahitian 🇵🇫🌴 origin with dual citizen ship 🇫🇷 - 🇨🇦, I have lived in France for ten years.

Holder of a master's degree in Aeronautical Mechanical Engineering, I worked for 3 years in aeronautics as a consultant.
 
I joined  in September 2020 the Fullstack Web Developer training course at the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-FR/campus/toulouse) in Toulouse.

I am currently looking for a company where to carry out my 6-month end-of-training internship from February 15th. The internship will focus on front-end, back-end or fullstack development as well as the technologies studied and practiced.

I would like to integrate myself into this company 🦄 for a long term period and i am therefore looking for an internship that can lead to a job creation. Finally, being keen on improving my skills, I would like to join a team whose expertise, high standards and cohesion will allow me to evolve as a developer.
